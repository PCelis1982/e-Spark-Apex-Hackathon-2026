**e-Spark** is a Web3 platform that measures, verifies, and tokenizes renewable electricity used in EV charging.

The solution ingests charging-session data and hourly grid or PPA energy intensity, applies compliance-grade methodologies, and anchors verified clean-energy claims on Hedera using native tokens.

By preventing double counting and enabling transparent certification, **e-Spark unlocks new revenue streams for EV operators while increasing trust, auditability, and scalability for clean-energy markets.**

The MVP demonstrates real-world energy data flowing into Hedera as verifiable, on-chain sustainability assets.

Project Scope — Hackathon Focus

e-Performance supports multiple regime modules:

Voluntary Carbon Credit preparation (energy-based substrate)

REDIII / RTFO compliance reporting

Guarantees of Origin validation

⚠️ Hackathon Focus

For the Hedera Apex Hackathon 2026, the active implementation scope is:

REDIII energy-based reporting (Ireland – RTFO/NORA)

Carbon and GO modules are architecturally supported but not implemented in this MVP.
